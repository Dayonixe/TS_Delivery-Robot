The aim of the project is to create a delivery robot within a company. It must allow exchanges between a sender and a recipient. A software must ensure the exchange, as well as the good functioning of the robot.

The main objectives are :
- Ensure the security of the delivery for the sender;
- Must adapt to its environment and be autonomous in its navigation;
- Must not endanger the sender, the receiver, nor the other employees (Cobot);
- Must be autonomous (in energy);
- The cargo must not exceed 10 kg.
